# American-Sign-Language-Recognition-using-CNN
American Sign Language (ASL) is the primary language used by many deaf individuals in North America, and it is also used by hard-of-hearing and hearing individuals. The language is as rich as spoken languages and employs signs made with the hand, along with facial gestures and bodily postures.

A lot of recent progress has been made towards developing computer vision systems that translate sign language to spoken language. This technology often relies on complex neural network architectures that can detect subtle patterns in streaming video. We have reduced the size of the problem by translating individual letters, instead of sentences.

In this notebook, we trained a convolutional neural network to classify images of American Sign Language (ASL) letters. After loading, examining, and preprocessing the data, we trained the network and tested its performance.
